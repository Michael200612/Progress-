# Progress-

Even though it is just the basics of python for the first 2 weeks, I am learning better ways of coding things that I had not known before.

I feel like I could have written plates.py in Week 2 a better way, just can't think of how that would be. 

The exceptions in week 3 are new to me and took a bit getting used to, but I can tell they will be very important in the future.
